# Routing-Algorithms-and-their-implementation
Implementation of Routing Algorithms (Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra) and their widest path Version:
To implement both Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra algorithms, Python is used. The widest path version of the above two algorithms are also implemented. Three different graphs are taken to compare their complexities. The taken example graphs represents loosely coupled, medium coupled and highly couple graphs Routing table is constructed considering node A as source node for each case. The performance is also compared, considering the no of loops as the parameter. The Big(O) complexity graph is also plotted to have a better view. For this, the graph having the same number of nodes and links is considered. 
The outputs of the codes are listed separately.
